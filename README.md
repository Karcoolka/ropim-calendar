# Getting Started with ROPIM Calendar 🎉
## Available Scripts 🚀
In the project directory, you can run:

### npm install 🛠️
Installs the necessary dependencies.

### npm start ▶️
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

To mock the API, let's run the script in a parallel terminal: 💻

### json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
This will mock the backend API.
You can view the mock data at http://localhost:5000/eventsList.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.
Any lint errors will appear in the console.

Enjoy! 👏
